Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed inoperable locally advanced or metastatic ER+ breast cancer. To fulfill the requirement for ER+ disease, a breast cancer must express, by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ER in ≥10% of cells, on the most recent biopsy. If ER quantification is not available, a determination of ER+ by IHC will suffice. Central confirmation of ER status is not required.
Participants must have documented HER2+ disease by overexpression and/or gene amplification on the most recent biopsy, per current ASCO-CAP (American Society of Clinical Oncology - College of American Pathologists) guidelines. Central confirmation of HER2 status is not required.

Participants must have received prior therapy with the following agents in any combination, and in setting (i.e., neoadjuvant, adjuvant, metastatic, etc.). These therapies do not need to be the most recent line of therapy.

Trastuzumab
Pertuzumab
Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1)
Participants must agree to undergo a research biopsy of a reasonably accessible metastatic lesion (chest wall, skin, subcutaneous tissue, lymph nodes, skin, breast, bones, lung, and liver metastases). If a reasonably accessible metastatic lesion is not available, the patient may go on study provided that archived tissue is available. However, if a reasonably accessible site is available for biopsy, the patient must agree to biopsy. Any patients not undergoing biopsy must be approved for study enrollment by the Overall Principal Investigator at DFCI. Biopsies may be done with local anesthesia or intravenous conscious sedation, according to institutional guidelines. If a biopsy requires general anesthesia, then it is only allowed if acquisition of tissue is clinically indicated, and excess tissue may be collected for research purposes. Patients without sites available for biopsy must have available tissue [archived formalin-fixed paraffin embedded blocks (FFPB), blocks from which slides can be created, or fresh frozen tissue from original diagnosis or metastatic setting] for correlative studies. Tissue needs to be located and available at the time of registration See Section 9.3 for more details.

Participants may have received any number of prior therapies as long as they have adequate performance status and meet all other eligibility criteria.
Women of childbearing potential (including premenopausal women and women less than 12 months after menopause) must have a negative β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) urine pregnancy test within 4 weeks of registration.
The effects of neratinib and fulvestrant on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because SERD agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to be abstinent, or to use a highly effective double barrier method of contraception (e.g, a combination of male condom with an intravaginal device such as the cervical cap, diaphragm, or vaginal sponge with spermicide) or a non-hormonal method, while enrolled in the study, until at least 28 days after the last dose of neratinib or 1 year after the last dose of fulvestrant. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. If a woman is of childbearing potential, she must agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for one year after completion of the study drug.
Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Exclusion Criteria:

Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.
Participants with known brain metastases that are untreated, symptomatic, or require therapy to control symptoms. Participants with a history of treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases are eligible. Treated brain metastases are defined as those without ongoing requirement for corticosteroids, as ascertained by clinical examination and/or brain imaging (magnetic resonance imaging or CT scan) completed during screening. Any corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without the subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥ 7 days prior to registration. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy, radiosurgery, surgery or a combination as deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Radiation therapy must be completed at least 14 days prior to registration.
Participant has active, uncontrolled cardiac disease, including cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association functional classification of ≥2), unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 12 months of enrollment, or ventricular arrhythmia.

Participant has an active infection or unexplained fever >38.5°C (101.3°F).
Participant has had another malignancy within the past 5 years with the exception of a) adequately treated basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell skin cancer, or thyroid cancer; b) carcinoma in situ of the breast, cervix or vulva; or c) cancer considered cured by surgical resection or unlikely to impact survival during the duration of the study, such as localized transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, or benign tumors of the adrenal or pancreas.
Participant has significant chronic gastrointestinal disorder with diarrhea as a major symptom (e.g., Crohn's disease, malabsorption, or Grade ≥2 (NCI CTCAE v.4.0) diarrhea of any etiology at screening).
Participant has known active infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis B and C serology testing is not required, unless active infection is suspected.
Participant is unable or unwilling to swallow tablets.
Participant has evidence of significant medical illness, abnormal laboratory finding, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would, in the Investigator's judgment, limit compliance with study requirements.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because fulvestrant is a SERD agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with neratinib and/or fulvestrant, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with neratinib and/or fulvestrant.",21,Indianapolis,United States,Indiana,46202,18 Years,,"Active, not recruiting",Phase 2,"Ian E.

Patients who did not receive chemotherapy should be randomized within 12 weeks after definitive surgery; such patients should have estradiol (E2) in the premenopausal range following surgery; the only patients who do not require testing of estradiol (E2) to confirm premenopausal status are those who have been menstruating regularly during the 6 months prior to randomization and have not used any form of hormonal contraception or any other hormonal treatments during the 6 months prior to randomization
Patients who received prior adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be randomized after completing chemotherapy and within 8 months of the final dose of chemotherapy as soon as premenopausal status is confirmed; all such patients should have premenopausal status confirmed by an estradiol (E2) in the premenopausal range between 2 weeks and 8 months after completing chemotherapy
Adjuvant trastuzumab (Herceptin ®) is allowable, and is not considered to be chemotherapy for eligibility timing determination
Patients with temporary chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea who regain premenopausal status within eight months of the final dose of chemotherapy are eligible; (please note that some patients taking tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, even without evidence of menses, may have ovarian function recovery following chemotherapy and resume estradiol secretion); in patients wishing to participate in the study, with postmenopausal hormone levels shortly after chemotherapy, it is recommended to recheck their estradiol level at a later timepoint within 8 months of completing chemotherapy, even in the absence of return of menses
Histologically proven, resected breast cancer; pathology material should be available for submission for central review as part of the quality control measures for this protocol
Patients must have hormone receptor positive tumors; if there is more than one breast tumor, each tumor must be hormone receptor positive; hormone receptors must be determined using immunohistochemistry; estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PgR) must be greater than or equal to 10% of the tumor cells positive by immunohistochemical evaluation; biochemical determination alone is not acceptable
The tumor must be confined to the breast and axillary nodes without detected metastases elsewhere, with the exception of tumor detected in internal mammary chain nodes by sentinel node procedure; patients who received neoadjuvant therapy must have had operable disease prior to neoadjuvant treatment to be eligible; patients who had a pathological evaluation with tru cut or core biopsy of invasive breast cancer prior to neoadjuvant therapy and were found to have no invasive tumor in the pathological specimen from definitive surgery are eligible; for these patients, pre-neoadjuvant tumor characteristics will be used for defining eligibility; in case of persistent disease, pathology findings from the definitive surgery should be used

Patients must have had proper surgery for primary breast cancer with no known clinical residual loco-regional disease:

A total mastectomy; radiotherapy is optional after mastectomy OR
A breast-conserving procedure (lumpectomy, quadrantectomy or partial mastectomy with margins clear of invasive cancer and ductal breast carcinoma in situ [DCIS]); the local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology report; if all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed; likewise, if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed; radiation therapy to the conserved breast is required; patients may be randomized before, during or after completion of radiation therapy to the breast
Either axillary lymph node dissection (pathological examination of at least 6 nodes recommended) or a negative axillary sentinel node biopsy (pN0[sn]) is required; patients with negative or microscopically axillary positive sentinel nodes (pN1mi: micrometastasis none > 2.0 mm) do not require further axillary therapy; those with positive sentinel nodes must have either an axillary dissection or radiation of axillary nodes
For International Breast Cancer Study Groups (IBCSG) centers, patients must have completed baseline Quality of Life (QL) Forms prior to randomization; the only exceptions are cognitive or physical impairment that interferes with QL assessment or inability to read any of the languages available on IBCSG QL forms; for non-IBCSG centers, extent of participation in the QL study is to be determined at the activation of the trial for each cooperative group
Written informed consent must be signed and dated by the patient and the investigator prior to randomization
Patients must be accessible for follow-up
Patients must be informed of and agree to data and tissue material transfer and handling, in accordance with national data protection guidelines

Any number of prior therapies is allowed.
Patients must consent to pre and on treatment research biopsies
Patients must have measurable disease.

Cohort 1 (TNBC):

Have diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer (defined as ER < 1% by IHC, PR < 1% by IHC, Her 2 negative by ASCO CAP guidelines).
Patients with TNBC may be enrolled in dose expansion cohort A with any number of prior lines of therapy (patients will be allowed to enroll in frontline setting).

Cohort 2 (HR+):

Have a diagnosis of ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer (defined as ER/PR > 1% by IHC).
Patients with ER+ and/or PR+ breast cancer must have progressed on at least 2 lines of endocrine therapy, unless ER/PR expression is low (< 10% positive) or weakly expressed, and the treating physician does not feel endocrine therapy is appropriate.

Exclusion Criteria:

Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.
Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering the study must have recovered from adverse events to Grade 1. Radiation within 3 months of study treatment initiation is prohibited, as serious rashes have been observed in patients who have recently received radiation therapy.
Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.
Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 agent, or mifepristone
Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to treatment.
History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to pembrolizumab or mifepristone
Uncontrolled intercurrent medical or psychiatric illness that would limit compliance with study requirements.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Mifepristone is an abortifacient agent with the potential for teratogenic effects.
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Mifepristone, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother wishes to participate in this study.
HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab and/or mifepristone. In addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.
Has evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis
Has an active infection requiring intravenous systemic therapy
Has received a live vaccine or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose of therapy. Administration of killed vaccines is allowed.
Has a known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), known active Hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive), or Hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected) infection.
Long term or concurrent use of corticosteroid therapy other than for premedication or supportive care use as detailed in the protocol. Physiologic doses of steroids (e.g. equivalent to or less than oral prednisone 10mg daily) are allowed and do not require approval.
Mifepristone can both inhibit CYP3A4 and induce CYP3A4. Addition of mifepristone to a pre-existing drug regimen may cause a mild and temporary increase in plasma drug concentration of drugs with significant CYP3A4 metabolism. Medications that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, St. John's Wort may decrease plasma mifepristone levels. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitor medications are expected to cause the largest increases in plasma mifepristone concentrations.
Mifepristone may increase the plasma drug concentration of concomitant medications with metabolism mediated by CYP2C9/CYP2C8. Drugs with the largest increases will be those whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP2C9/2C8 and include: Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and warfarin.

Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed HER2-positive disease by local pathology, defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or amplification by FISH (HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2 or an average of ≥6 HER2 gene copies per nucleus) AND confirmed by Central Pathology Review (Dr. Deborah Dillon at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) prior to patient being registered to begin protocol therapy. See section 3.4. http://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jco.2013.50.9984
NOTE: DCIS components should not be counted in the determination of HER2 status.
Age ≥60 years at the time of study registration (men and women eligible)
Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage I-III breast cancer with the following criteria met:
If node-negative or if node status unknown (because it was not assessed), tumor must be >5 mm of any hormone receptor subtype (document ER/PR status: if some ER/PR staining is present, ER and PR negative are defined as being positive in <10% cells [per local pathology read]).
If node-positive (N1-N3), T1mi, T1a, T1b, T1c, T2, or T3 tumors are eligible (see below for further details on defining node-negative disease) Definition of node-negative disease (when node status known): If the patient has had a negative sentinel node biopsy and/or a negative axillary dissection, then the patient is determined to be node-negative. Axillary nodes with single cells or tumor clusters ≤ 0.2 mm by either H&E or IHC will be considered node-negative. Any axillary lymph node with tumor clusters between 0.02 and 0.2cm is considered a micrometastasis. Patients with a micrometastasis are eligible even if their tumor is </= 5mm. An axillary dissection is not required to be performed in patients with a positive sentinel node and management of the axilla will be left up to the treating provider. In cases where the specific pathologic size of lymph node involvement is subject to interpretation, the principal investigator will make the final determination as to eligibility. In these special situations, the investigator must document this approval in the patient medical record.
ER/PR determination assays performed by IHC methods according to the local institution standard protocol.
Standard chemotherapy/trastuzumab declined by patient OR patient is deemed by physician for any reason to not be a candidate for standard therapy (i.e. patient and/or provider choose not to pursue standard trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimen because of concerns related to toxicity or provider/patient preference).
For patients with bilateral or multifocal/multicentric breast cancers, one of the following criteria must be met to enroll: (1) each cancer individually meets criteria for enrollment (only ONE tumor has to undergo central confirmation for HER2), (2) at least one tumor meets eligibility (per tumor size/nodes/subtype outlined above) and the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are also HER2-positive but are too small for enrollment (e.g., a patient is eligible if a cancer is T2N0 and HER2-positive in one breast, but the contralateral breast has a T1a HER2+ cancer that isn't eligible on its own, (3) there is at least one qualifying tumor of >5mm but there are other small foci of disease that are too small to test for ER/PR/HER2 and are felt to be a part of the same tumor or similar tumor, OR (4) at least one tumor meets eligibility and the other foci in the ipsilateral or contralateral breast are HER2-negative and do not meet criteria for adjuvant chemotherapy per provider discretion (e.g. if a patient has a HER2-positive tumor meeting eligibility but also has a second, HER2-negative, small, node-negative, ER+, low grade cancer present, she is still eligible for enrollment). However, in the specific case that a second breast cancer is stage III and HER2-negative, that patient is excluded (because the second cancer is high-risk and likely will require non-HER2-directed therapy).
All tumor removed by either a modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy (lumpectomy).

NOTE: Management of axillary lymph nodes is up to the treating provider; however, all surgical margins should be clear of invasive cancer or DCIS (i.e., no tumor on ink). The local pathologist must document negative margins of resection in the pathology report. If all other margins are clear, a positive posterior (deep) margin is permitted, provided the surgeon documents that the excision was performed down to the pectoral fascia and all tumor has been removed. Likewise, if all other margins are clear, a positive anterior (superficial; abutting skin) margin is permitted provided the surgeon documents that all tumor has been removed.

-≤90 days from the patient's most recent breast surgery for this breast cancer. Note: In cases where registration will occur >90 days from surgery but within an acceptable time frame, patient may be eligible for enrollment with approval from the PI, Rachel Freedman MD, MPH.

Life expectancy >5 years per provider's assessment
Willing to employ adequate and appropriate birth control if applicable
NOTE: This study is for patients aged 60 and older, and most female patients will have entered menopause by this time; however patients should not become pregnant while on this study because T-DM1 can affect an unborn baby. Pre-menopausal women need to use birth control while on this study and women should not breastfeed a baby while on this study. Any man treated on this study will also need to use contraception if his partner is a premenopausal female. Patients should check with their health care provider about what kind of birth control methods to use and how long to use them.

451,452,NCT00087178,Comparison of Two Combination Chemotherapy Regimens in Treating Women With Breast Cancer,Breast Cancer,Interventional,"Eligibility

Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age.
The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, excluding her diagnosis of breast cancer. (Comorbid conditions and performance status should be taken into consideration, but not the diagnosis of breast cancer.)
The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer treatment (lumpectomy, mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary surgery, or re-excision of lumpectomy margins) and randomization must be no more than 84 days.
The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination. (Patients with tumors that are pure tubular or mucinous adenocarcinomas are not eligible.)
The primary tumor must be T1-3 by clinical and pathologic evaluation.
Lymph nodes obtained from all axillary staging procedures must be pN0 according to pathologic staging criteria of the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Cancer Staging Manual.
Patients must have undergone axillary nodal staging procedures, for example sentinel node (SN) biopsy alone, SN biopsy followed by axillary sampling or completion dissection, or axillary node dissection to obtain lymph nodes for pathologic evaluation. If the patient has palpable nodes, axillary dissection is required.
Patients must have an estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must be performed. If ER is positive, PgR analysis is desired, but not mandatory. (""Marginal"" or ""borderline"" results [i.e., those not definitively negative] will be considered positive regardless of the methodology used.)
Patients must have had either a lumpectomy or total mastectomy.
Patients must have no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.
Patients with skeletal pain are eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan or roentgenological examination fail to disclose metastatic disease. Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.

The patient's menopausal status must be determined prior to randomization.

Pre- and postmenopausal women are eligible. The following criteria will be used to define postmenopausal:
a prior documented bilateral oophorectomy, or
a history of at least 12 months without spontaneous menstrual bleeding, or
age 55 or older with a prior hysterectomy or
age 54 or younger with a prior hysterectomy without oophorectomy (or in whom the status of the ovaries is unknown), with a documented follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level demonstrating confirmatory elevation in the lab's postmenopausal range.
Women failing to meet one of these criteria will be classified as premenopausal.
At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and PA and lateral chest x-ray or chest CT within the past 3 months; bilateral mammogram within the past 6 months; and pelvic exam (for women who have a uterus and who will be receiving tamoxifen) within the past year.
Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline LVEF measured by Multi Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram equal to or greater than the lower limit of normal for the facility performing the procedure.

At the time of randomization:

The postoperative absolute granulocyte count (AGC) must be greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (or greater than or equal to 1200/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variant of normal).
Postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3. Significant underlying hematologic disorders must be excluded when the platelet count is above the ULN for the lab.
There must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e.,
total bilirubin must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a chronic Grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and
alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and
the aspartate transaminase (AST) [serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)] must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.
There must be postoperative evidence of normal renal function (serum creatinine less than or equal to ULN).
Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery Patients treated by lumpectomy followed by breast radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:

Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met.
The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients in whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible.
This is a node-negative study, therefore irradiation of regional lymph nodes is prohibited in this trial.
Whole breast irradiation is required unless the patient is assigned to the partial breast irradiation group on NSABP B-39.
Postmastectomy chest wall irradiation at the investigator's discretion is permitted. However, this is a node-negative study; therefore irradiation of regional lymph nodes is prohibited in this trial.

Ineligibility

Male patients are not eligible for this study.
Pure tubular or mucinous adenocarcinomas.
Bilateral malignancy (including DCIS) or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.
Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason.
Suspicious palpable nodes in the ipsilateral or contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes. Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.
Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible).

Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. The only exceptions are:

Hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy.
If patient is enrolled in NSABP B-39 and randomized to Group 2, partial breast irradiation (PBI) may be completed prior to beginning treatment on NSABP B-36.
Prior anthracycline therapy for any malignancy.
Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc.. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)
Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization. With the exception of tamoxifen, these medications are not permitted while on the study.)

Cardiac disease that would preclude the use of anthracyclines. This includes:

any documented myocardial infarction;
angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication;
any history of documented congestive heart failure;
serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication,
severe conduction abnormality;
valvular disease with documented cardiac function compromise; and
poorly controlled hypertension, i.e., diastolic greater than 100 mm/Hg. (Patients with hypertension that is well controlled on medication are eligible for entry.)
Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.
Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception.
Concurrent treatment with investigational agents.
Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.

Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery. For patients treated by lumpectomy, breast irradiation is required. The following patients will be ineligible:

Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)
Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.
Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to obtain free margins are allowed. Patients in whom tumor is still present after the additional resection(s) must undergo mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)",2722,Huntsville,United States,Alabama,35805,18 Years,,Completed,Phase 3,,,NSABP Foundation Inc,cyclophosphamide,May 2004,

SLNB is rountinely performed after NAC using dual tracer mapping with technetium-99m sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue dye. Radioactive, blue, or palpably abnormal nodes were considered SLNs. In patients presenting with clips, localization of the clipped node was performed and surgeons were aware if the clipped node was retrieved during the SLNB.
A minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8 total nodes (sentinel + non-sentinel+/-clipped nodes) are identified and excised; more than 8 biopsied nodes identified by either surgeon or pathologist is not allowed Note: Patients who do not have an identifiable SLN will not be enrolled
Zero or one lymph node (sentinel + non-sentinel+/-clipped nodes) excised during SLNB or TAD with a metastasis identified on intra-operative pathologic assessment Note: Nodal macro/micro-metastasis (greater than 0.2 mm in greatest dimension) and isolated tumor cells (metastases less than or equal to 0.2 mm) will be treated as node positive disease (N0i+) Note: If on final pathology, more than 8 lymph nodes are seen pathologically, or two or more than two nodes turn positive pathologically, then the patient should not be recruited into the study.
Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is not to be performed prior to registration/randomization

The patient must consent to participate in the study and must have signed an approved consent form conforming with federal and institutional guidelines.
The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and a Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1. (Comorbid conditions but not the diagnosis of breast cancer should be taken into consideration when determining life expectancy.)
The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer staging or treatment and randomization must be no more than 84 days.
The tumor must be invasive carcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.

All of the following staging criteria must be met:

By clinical and pathologic evaluation, primary tumor must be T1-3;
By clinical evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be cN0, cN1, or cN2a;
By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN1 (pN1mi, pN1a, pN1b, pN1c), pN2a, pN3a, or pN3b (only if due to microscopic involvement of internal mammary node detected by sentinel lymph node dissection and with more than 3 positive axillary lymph nodes).
Patients must have an estrogen receptor (ER) analysis performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. If ER analysis is negative, then progesterone receptor (PgR) analysis must be performed. If ER analysis is positive, PgR analysis is desired, but not mandatory. (""Marginal"" or ""borderline"" results [i.e., those not definitely negative] will be considered positive regardless of the methodology used.)

Patients must have had either a lumpectomy or a total mastectomy. Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status.

Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes (This approach is strongly recommended.)
Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone if one of the following criteria is met:
Pathologic nodal staging based on sentinel lymphadenectomy is pN1mi or pN1b
Surgeon elects not to remove additional non-sentinel nodes (This approach is strongly discouraged, but will not preclude participation in B-38.)
Axillary lymphadenectomy without sentinel node isolation procedure.
Patients must have no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.
Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scans fail to demonstrate metastatic disease. Suspicious findings on bone scan must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.

Patients with aspartate transaminase (AST) or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging fails to demonstrate metastatic disease and the following requirements are met at the time of randomization.

Postoperative absolute granulocyte count (AGC) must be greater than or equal to 1200/mm3.
Postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000/mm3.

The following criteria for postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:

total bilirubin must be less than or equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome due to slow conjugation of bilirubin; and
alkaline phosphatase must be less than or equal to 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and
the AST must be less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab; and
alkaline phosphatase and AST cannot both be greater than ULN.
Postoperative serum creatinine must be less than or equal to ULN.
At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and imaging of the chest within the past 3 months and bilateral mammogram within the past 6 months.
Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), measured by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram, greater than or equal to lower limit of normal (LLN) for the facility performing the procedure and no evidence of regional wall abnormalities.
Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:

Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible if eligibility criteria for lumpectomy are met.
The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients for whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary evaluation has been completed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible without additional resection.)
Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but plans for radiation therapy must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.
Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: radiation therapy o Postmastectomy chest wall and/or regional nodal irradiation is optional. Plans for radiation in mastectomy patients must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.

Ineligibility Criteria

Male patients are not eligible for this study. Women with one or more of the following conditions or prior therapies are also ineligible for this study:
Tumor that has been determined to be human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive by immunohistochemistry (3+) or by fluorescent in situ hybridization (positive for gene amplification).
Contralateral breast cancer (invasive or DCIS) or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.
Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason.
Clinical nodal stages including cN2b and cN3 or pathologic nodal stages including pN0(i+), pN2b, pN3b with clinically apparent internal mammary nodes, or pN3c.
Suspicious nodes in the contralateral axilla or suspicious supraclavicular nodes. Patients with these conditions are considered ineligible unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.
Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of LCIS are eligible).
Treatment, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. One exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before study entry. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started, if indicated, following chemotherapy. A second exception is radiation therapy for patients enrolled in NSABP B-39 and assigned to partial breast irradiation (Group 2). These patients may have received RT prior to B-38 study entry.
Prior therapy with anthracyclines or taxanes for any malignancy.
Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)
Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or breast cancer prevention. (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization.

Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from receiving any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.
History of hepatitis B or C.
Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception.
Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents for the treatment of breast cancer.
Psychiatric or addictive disorders or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from meeting the study requirements.

Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: radiation therapy and surgery

For patients treated by lumpectomy, whole breast irradiation is required.
The following patients will be ineligible:
Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) treated with lumpectomy. (These patients are eligible if they undergo mastectomy.)
Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant.

Exclusion Criteria:

Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.
Participants with known brain metastases, or any other metastases from cancer.
Participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product.
Uncontrolled inter-current illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements. Patient has impairment of gastrointestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., ulcerative diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small bowel resection).

Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization abnormality including any of the following:

History of angina pectoris, symptomatic pericarditis, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to study entry.
Documented cardiomyopathy.
Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) <50% as determined by Multiple Gated acquisition (MUGA) scan or echocardiogram (ECHO) detected during screening.

History of hypersensitivity to ribociclib or any of its components.
HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible. These participants are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of ribociclib is not established in pregnant women. For this reason and because CDK4/6 agents as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of treatment, and for at least 3 months after the completion of treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician immediately. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. In addition, men enrolled on this study should understand the risks to any sexual partner of childbearing potential. All WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of the investigational agent(s). Registration may occur prior to this pregnancy test. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive protocol treatment and must not be enrolled in the study. WOCBP is defined as follows: Any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or a bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea > 12 consecutive months, or women on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level > 35 mIU/ml). Even women who are using oral, implanted, or injectable contraceptive hormones or mechanical products (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy or practicing abstinence or where partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy), should be considered to be a WOCBP.

Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:

Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception
Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment
Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.
In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction",120,Boston,United States,Massachusetts,02214,18 Years,,Recruiting,Phase 2,Aditya Bardia,Massachusetts General Hospital,Massachusetts General Hospital,Ribociclib,"December 12, 2017",Aditya Bardia

The patient must have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, excluding her diagnosis of breast cancer. (Comorbid conditions should be taken into consideration, but not the diagnosis of breast cancer.)
The interval between the last surgery for breast cancer treatment (lumpectomy, mastectomy, axillary dissection, or re-excision of lumpectomy margins) and randomization must be less than or equal to 84 days.

All of the following staging criteria must be met:

Primary tumor must be T1-3 by clinical and pathologic evaluation.
Ipsilateral nodes must be cN0-1 by clinical evaluation.
Ipsilateral nodes must be pN1, pN2a, or pN3a by pathologic evaluation.
M0
Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy and an axillary dissection or a lumpectomy and an axillary dissection. Sentinel node biopsy is permitted, but must be followed by an axillary dissection.
The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination.
The tumor must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to randomization. Assays performed using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) require gene amplification to be eligible. Assays using immunohistochemistry (IHC) must be performed at an NSABP-approved reference laboratory and require a strongly positive staining score.
Patients must have an analysis of both estrogen and progesterone receptors performed on the primary tumor prior to randomization. ""Marginal,"" ""borderline,"" etc., results (i.e., those not definitely negative) will also be considered positive regardless of the methodology used.
At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following: history and physical exam, EKG, and PA and lateral chest x-ray within the past 3 months; and a bilateral mammogram (or unilateral if patient has had a mastectomy) and a pelvic exam (for women who have a uterus and who will be taking tamoxifen) within the past year.
Within 3 months prior to entry, the patient must have a baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by MUGA scan equal to or greater than the lower limit of normal for the radiology facility. (If LVEF is > 75%, the investigator should consider having the LVEF determination reviewed prior to randomization. Following randomization, the LVEF determination may be reviewed up until the time of the post-AC MUGA. Please note that if a more accurate value is obtained from the review of the baseline MUGA, the corrected value must be submitted to the NSABP Biostatistical Center before the post-AC MUGA is performed.)

At the time of randomization:

The postoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be ≥ 1500/mm3 (or <1500/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variation of normal).
Postoperative platelet count must be ≥ 100,000/mm3. Significant underlying hematologic disorders must be excluded when the platelet count is above the upper limit of normal for the lab.
There must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e., total bilirubin must be ≤ ULN for the lab unless the patient has a chronic grade 1 bilirubin elevation (>ULN to ≤1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome; and alkaline phosphatase must be <2.5 times the ULN for the lab; and the serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT [AST]) must be <1.5 times the ULN for the lab.
There must be postoperative evidence of adequate renal function (serum creatinine within or less than the institution's normal range).
Patients must have no clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease. Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by radiologic evaluation or biopsy. A patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease.
Patients with a history of non-breast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for 5 or more years prior to randomization and are deemed by their physician to be at low risk for recurrence. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
Prior to randomization, the investigator must designate whether the patients who had a lumpectomy will receive local or locoregional radiation therapy. For patients who had a mastectomy, the investigator must designate whether or not the patient will receive radiation therapy. (Pre-randomization discussion and/or consultation with a radiation oncologist is encouraged.) Note: Irradiation of any internal mammary nodes is prohibited in this trial.
Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: irradiation and surgery
Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection to be followed by breast radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following: Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors <5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors ≥ 5 cm are eligible. The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. In patients in whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. Whole breast irradiation is required. Irradiation of regional lymph nodes is optional, but partial breast irradiation and irradiation of any internal mammary nodes are prohibited in this trial. Intent to irradiate the axilla or other regional node groups must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes.
Special conditions for eligibility of mastectomy patients: irradiation. The decision to use locoregional irradiation in patients who have undergone total mastectomy and axillary node dissection must be declared by the investigator prior to randomization for stratification purposes. Failure to adhere to the radiation therapy plan will be a protocol violation.

Exclusion criteria

Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.
Primary tumor staged as T4 for any reason.
Nodes staged as clinical N2 or N3 for any reason and nodes staged as pathologic pN2b, pN3b, or pN3c.
Prior history of breast cancer, including DCIS (patients with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ [LCIS] are eligible).
Treatment including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to randomization. The only exception is hormonal therapy, which may have been given for up to a total of 28 days anytime after diagnosis and before randomization. In such a case, hormonal therapy must stop at or before randomization and be re-started if indicated following chemotherapy.
Prior anthracycline or taxane therapy for any malignancy.
Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.)
Therapy with any hormonal agents such as raloxifene (Evista®), tamoxifen, or other selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), either for osteoporosis or prevention. (Patients are eligible only if these medications are discontinued prior to randomization. These medications are not permitted while on the study except for the use of tamoxifen as described in the protocol)
Nonmalignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.

This protocol excludes pregnant or lactating women based on the fetal toxicity of both tamoxifen and Taxol which are listed as Pregnancy Category D agents. Pregnant women who received tamoxifen have experienced fetal deaths, birth defects, spontaneous abortions, and vaginal bleeding. Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective barrier method of contraception. Hormonal birth control methods are not permitted.
Sensory/motor neuropathy ≥ grade 2, as defined by the NCI's Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0.
Contraindications to corticosteroid use which, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study.
Concurrent treatment with other investigational agents.
Sensitivity to benzyl alcohol.

Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: irradiation and surgery. For patients treated by lumpectomy with axillary dissection, breast irradiation is required. Please see guidelines for radiation therapy in Appendix A. In addition, the following patients will also be ineligible:

Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy.
Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.
Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to obtain free margins are allowed. Patients in whom tumor is still present after the additional resection(s) must undergo mastectomy to be eligible.",2130,Huntsville,United States,Alabama,35801,18 Years,,Completed,Phase 3,,,NSABP Foundation Inc,herceptin,February 2000,

- Prior cancer therapy:

Metastatic disease:

First line treatment (amendment 2018):

No prior chemotherapy*. Prior endocrine therapy +/- CDK4/6 inhibitor or mTOR inhibitors is allowed if hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative disease.

Late-stage disease (approved protocol):

i) Prior exposure to and resistance to a taxane regimen**. ii) Prior exposure to and resistance to an anthracycline regimen** -mandatory only for patients with TP53 wt tumors.

LABC:

i) Prior exposure to and lack of response to to a taxane regimen**. ii) Prior exposure to and lack of response to an anthracycline regimen** - mandatory only for patients with TP53 wt tumors.

In LABC lack of response is defined as stable disease (SD) after 4 courses of chemotherapy or PD. Breast cancer relapsing within 12 months subsequent to adjuvant taxanes or anthracyclines is considered resistant and re-exposure is not required prior to inclusion in the trial. This relates also to patients who could not receive proper taxane or anthracycline therapy due to side effects or other medical reasons.

Conditions for eligibility for patients with LABC (Cohort A):

The diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast must have been made by core needle biopsy or limited incisional biopsy.
Patients must have clinical Stage IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC disease with a mass in the breast or axilla that is greater than or equal to 2.0 cm measured by clinical exam, unless the patient has inflammatory breast carcinoma, in which case measurable disease is not required.

Conditions for eligibility for patients with resected Stage III breast cancer (Cohort B)

Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy.

Patients must have completed one of the following procedures for evaluation of pathologic nodal status.

Sentinel lymphadenectomy followed by removal of additional non-sentinel lymph nodes, or
Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure.
The interval between the last surgery (for breast cancer treatment or staging) and study entry must be no more than 84 days.
By pathologic evaluation, ipsilateral nodes must be pN2 or pN3.
For patients who undergo lumpectomy, the margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and DCIS as determined by the local pathologist. If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)
For patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.

Conditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)

The patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.
Patients must be female.
The patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.
The patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.
The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.
The breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.

At the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.
Platelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.
Hemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.

The following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:

total bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and
alkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and
AST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.
Alkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.
Patients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.
Patients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.
Serum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.
Urine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.
All patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.
Note: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.

Exclusion Criteria:

Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)

FNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.
Surgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. (Procedures that are permitted include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.

Condition for patient ineligibility (Cohort B)

• Breast reconstruction using tissue expanders or implants at the time of mastectomy.

Conditions for patient ineligibility (ALL patients)

Patients must have undergone either a total mastectomy or a lumpectomy with either an axillary dissection or sentinel node biopsy. If any sentinel node is histologically positive by H & E, or histologically suspicious on H & E and confirmed positive by immunohistochemistry (IHC), then the patient must have a completion axillary dissection.
The tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma on histologic examination with clinical assessment T1-3, N0-1, M0.

Patients must not be participating in any other clinical trials of systemic therapy for early-stage breast cancer. Patients may participate in the following radiation therapy trials:

Node-positive patients may participate in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group protocol MA.20, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met. (Node-negative B-34 patients may not participate in MA.20.)
Node-positive mastectomy patients may participate in Southwest Oncology Group protocol S9927, provided the requirements of the B-34 protocol continue to be met.
Patients must have an analysis of both estrogen and progesterone receptors on the primary tumor performed prior to randomization. Tumors will be defined as ER or progesterone receptor (PgR) positive if: 1) the Dextran-coated charcoal or sucrose-density gradient method shows them to have greater than or equal to 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, or 2) if using individual laboratory criteria they can be shown to be positive by the enzyme immunoassay method (EIA) or immunocytochemical assay. ""Marginal or borderline,"" results (i.e., those not definitively negative) will also be considered positive.
At the time of randomization, the patient must have had the following within the past 3 months: history and physical exam, a bone scan, thoracic and lumbar spine x-rays, and a chest x-ray. Within the past 12 months patients must have had a gynecologic exam (for women who have a uterus and who will be taking tamoxifen) and a bilateral mammogram.

At the time of randomization:

the postoperative absolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than or equal to 1500/mm3 (or less than 1500/mm3 if, in the opinion of the investigator, this represents an ethnic or racial variation of normal);
the postoperative platelet count must be greater than or equal to 100,000;
there must be postoperative evidence of adequate hepatic function, i.e.,
total bilirubin at or below the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory; and
alkaline phosphatase less than 2.5 x the ULN; and
the serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT)/ aspartate transaminase (AST) less than 1.5 x the ULN;
there must be postoperative evidence of adequate renal function (serum creatinine within or less than the laboratory's normal range).
Serum albumin and serum calcium must be within normal limits.
A patient with skeletal pain is eligible for inclusion in the study if bone scan and/or roentgenological examination fails to disclose metastatic disease. Suspicious findings must be confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.
Patients with prior nonbreast malignancies are eligible if they have been disease- free for greater than or equal to 5 years before randomization and are deemed at low risk for recurrence by their treating physicians. Patients with squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin that has been effectively treated, carcinoma in situ of the cervix that has been treated by surgery only, or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast treated by hormone therapy and/or surgery only are eligible, even if these were diagnosed within 5 years before randomization.
Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.

Special conditions for eligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. Patients treated by lumpectomy and axillary node dissection (or no axillary dissection if sentinel node biopsy is negative) to be followed by breast radiation therapy must meet all the eligibility criteria in addition to the following:

Generally, lumpectomy should be reserved for tumors less than 5 cm. However, at the investigator's discretion, patients treated with lumpectomy for tumors greater than or equal to 5 cm are eligible.
The margins of the resected specimen must be histologically free of invasive tumor and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). For patients in whom pathologic examination demonstrates tumor present at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. This is permissible even if axillary dissection has been performed. Patients in whom tumor is still present at the resected margins after re-excision(s) must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible.

Ineligibility.

Significant non-malignant bone disease that is likely to interfere with the interpretation of bone x-rays.
Ulceration, erythema, infiltration of the skin or the underlying chest wall (complete fixation), peau d'orange, or skin edema of any magnitude. (Tethering or dimpling of the skin or nipple inversion should not be interpreted as skin infiltration. Patients with these conditions are eligible.)
Ipsilateral lymph nodes that on clinical examination are found to be fixed to one another or to other structures (cN2 disease).
Suspicious palpable nodes in the contralateral axilla or palpable supraclavicular or infraclavicular nodes, unless there is biopsy evidence that these are not involved with tumor.
Prior therapy for breast cancer, including irradiation, chemotherapy, biotherapy, and/or hormonal therapy, with the exception of tamoxifen. Tamoxifen may be given as adjuvant therapy before study entry, but only if it was started within 28 days before randomization. Patients who started tamoxifen within 28 days before randomization and who are being considered for chemotherapy must have their tamoxifen stopped at the start of chemotherapy.
Prior history of breast cancer, except LCIS.
Any sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormonal replacement therapy, etc. (These patients are eligible only if this therapy is discontinued prior to randomization.) Exceptions: patients may use low-dose estrogen vaginal creams or Estring® for symptomatic vaginal dryness, raloxifene (or other selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs]) for the prevention of osteoporosis, and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists for the purpose of medical ovarian ablation as a component of adjuvant therapy for the breast cancer.
Patients currently taking alendronate (Fosamax®) or other bisphosphonates or calcitonin to treat or prevent osteoporosis are not eligible.
Non-malignant systemic disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) that would preclude a patient from being subjected to any of the treatment options or would prevent prolonged follow-up.
Psychiatric or addictive disorders that would preclude obtaining informed consent.
Pregnancy or lactation at the time of proposed randomization. This protocol excludes pregnant or lactating women because the effects of clodronate on such women have not been studied fully.
Bilateral malignancy or a mass or mammographic abnormality in the opposite breast suspicious for malignancy unless there is biopsy proof that the mass is not malignant.

Special conditions for ineligibility of lumpectomy patients: Irradiation and surgery. The following patients will also be ineligible:

Patients with diffuse tumors (as demonstrated on mammography) that would not be considered surgically amenable to lumpectomy.
Patients treated with lumpectomy in whom there is another clinically dominant mass or mammographically suspicious abnormality within the ipsilateral breast remnant. Such a mass must be biopsied and demonstrated to be histologically benign prior to randomization or, if malignant, must be surgically removed with clear margins.
Patients in whom the margins of the resected specimen are involved with invasive tumor or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Additional surgical resections to obtain free margins are allowed. Patients in whom tumor is still present after the additional resection(s) must undergo mastectomy to be eligible.",3323,Scottsdale,United States,Arizona,85259-5404,18 Years,,Completed,Phase 3,,,NSABP Foundation Inc,clodronate,January 2001,
